#+TITLE: Godot Engine REPL Module
#+AUTHOR: Franco Eus√©bio Garcia

* Information

This adds a Repeat, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL) module to Godot, allowing one
to evaluate GDScript expressions in the editor itself.

* Example

See the =GDScriptREPL= project.

Currently, the REPL is missing the =L= (loop) part.

* Godot 2

For Godot 2 support, please refer to the [[https://github.com/francogarcia/GD-REPL/tree/Godot2-REPL][Godot2-REPL]] tag.

* TODO Installation
