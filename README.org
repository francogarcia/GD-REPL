#+TITLE: Godot Engine REPL Module
#+AUTHOR: Franco Eus√©bio Garcia

* Information

This adds a Repeat, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL) module to Godot, allowing one
to evaluate GDScript expressions in the editor itself.

* Example

See the =editor_plugin= project.

Currently, it only supports expressions which evaluates to a result (or a call
to an existing function).

* Installation

Clone or extract this project into Godot's ~module~ directory. Then follow the
instructions to build Godot to your platform.

** Linux (X11)
